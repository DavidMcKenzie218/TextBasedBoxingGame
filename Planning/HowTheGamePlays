Using a turn based system the player will choose and attack from the buttons on screen.
Upon pressing the button the game will work out if the attack hit or missed.
If the attack hits a message will appear to screen from a list of possible attack messages.
If the attack hits then the enemy will loose health depending on the attack damage.
If the attack missed a message will appear to the screen from a list of possible miss messages.
If the attack misses then the turn will continue.

The enemy will then attack.
The game will choose an attack for the enemy.
The game will then see if the attak hit or missed.
If the attack hits then the player will loose health depending on the damage of the attack.
If the attack hits then a message will appear to screen from a list of attack messages.
If the attack misses then a message will appear to the screen from a list of miss messages.
